To run songs.py, you must first:

1. Install Selenium Python bindings.
	http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html
	- easiest method: type "pip install selenium" in Command Prompt or Terminal

2. Download ChromeDriver.
	http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
	- click on the link for "Latest Release", download the right zip, and extract
	- put the file (chromedriver.exe) into the same folder as songs.py

3. Make sure Chrome/Chromium is installed on your computer.

4. The way songs.py is programmed, it currently only supports Windows.
	- if you're on Mac, see if you can change the code to work!
	- (hint: Macs don't use .exe files)
